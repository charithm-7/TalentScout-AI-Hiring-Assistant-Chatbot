Project Update

This project was enhanced after the initial implementation to make it more practical and closer to a real-world hiring workflow.

The updated version now includes automatic answer evaluation using a local pre-trained Large Language Model (LLaMA 3 via Ollama). Each candidate response is evaluated as either correct or incorrect, and a binary score is assigned (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect).

All candidate information, interview questions, answers, evaluation results, and scores are now stored in a structured SQLite database. This allows recruiters to easily view complete candidate profiles and shortlist candidates based on their responses and scores.

These updates improve the reliability, usability, and real-world applicability of the hiring assistant while keeping the system simple and independent of paid APIs.
